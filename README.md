# ModoAlgorithm
An algorithm to generate all nondominated solutions for multiobjective discrete optimization (MODO) problems with any number of objective functions.

This is a generic and highly customizable implementation of the algorithm proposed by [Kirlik and Sayin (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221713006474).
